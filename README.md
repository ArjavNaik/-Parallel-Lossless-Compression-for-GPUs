# -Parallel-Lossless-Compression-for-GPUs
Description can be found in the Final_Report file
- Implemented Parallel version (GPU Version) of DEFLATE algorithm which is used for G-Zip compression. 
- Compared the speed up of parallel algorithm with respect to serial algorithm. - For the implementation CUDA C was used.
